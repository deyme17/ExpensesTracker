- 🔍 Transaction detail viewer, filtering, and sorting tools  
- 🌐 Language UI with flexible `LanguageMapper`  
- 💱 Total balance overview (per account)  
- 📊 Built-in basic financial statistics and dynamic graphs of incomes and expenses<br>
        -Line chart for dynamics over time  
        -Histogram for distribution  
        -Pie charts for category-wise comparison 

## Architecture & Design

- 🧭 **Client-server architecture** with RESTful API  
- 🛠️ **Backend**: Flask app with PostgreSQL and main application with SQLite
- 📱 **Frontend**: Kivy mobile GUI with clean UI/UX  
- ⚙️ **Asynchronous Processing**: 
          - Celery distributed task queue for webhook processing
          - Redis as message broker for reliable task delivery
          - Asynchronous data loading using `Threading`
- 🔐 **Security**: 
  - JWT-based user authentication  
  - Monobank token encryption + secure storage  
  - Password hashing using `bcrypt`  
- 📂 **Design Patterns**:
          - **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) as the backbone of frontend logic  
          - **Repository pattern** for database abstraction  
          - **Factory pattern** for dynamic object creation (e.g., charts, services)  
          - **Strategy pattern** for different data processing pipelines  
- 📦 Dockerized deployment with environment configuration  
- 📚 Extensive class and method documentation  
- 🔄 Dependency inversion principle followed for clean service injection
